# Biography

Dr. Xing Wang joined Rensselaer in 2014 as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. He is also a faculty member affiliated with the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS), the Biochemistry and Biophysical Program (BCBP), and the Center for Materials, Devices, and Integrated Systems (cMDIS) at RPI. After Dr. Wang obtained his Ph.D. at New York University (with Dr. Ned Seeman ) in 2009, he joined Princeton University as a postdoc fellow (with Dr. Laura Landweber) to explore novel functions of non-coding RNA (small and long) in genome editing and rearrangement.

Dr. Wang's Nucleic Acids Programming Lab at RPI currently is focused on the design and synthesis of functional DNA/RNA aptamers, nanostructures and nanodevices, and on the exploration of their uses in energy harvesting (e.g., building energy transfer arrays), basic biology (e.g., elucidating the underlying mechanism for chromosome/DNA homologous pairing), diagnostics in low-resource environment (e.g., sensing different microbiota and viruses), and therapeutics (e.g., developing unique cancer treatment).
